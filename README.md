# Secret indios app

A Secret Santa app is a tool that allows a group of people to participate in a gift-giving game, often organized around the holidays. Here are some features that you might consider including in your app design:

* Invitation and group management: Users should be able to create a group and invite other people to join, either by sharing a unique group code or by entering their email addresses.

* Gift preferences: Users should be able to specify their gift preferences, such as preferred price range and types of gifts they would like to receive.

* Assignments: The app should randomly assign each user in the group to be the Secret Santa for another member.

* Reminders: The app should send reminders to participants to buy and send their gifts.

* Chat function: Users should be able to communicate with each other within the app, either through a group chat or through private messages.

* Security: To maintain the element of surprise, the app should not reveal the identity of a user's Secret Santa until the appropriate time.

* Themes: The app should allow users to choose a theme for their gift exchange, such as a specific holiday or interest.

* Gift tracking: Users should be able to mark off when they have sent or received their gift, to help keep track of the exchange.

* Rating system: Users should be able to rate the gifts they receive, to help others get a better idea of what types of gifts are most appreciated.

* Customization: The app should allow users to customize the look and feel of their gift exchange, such as by choosing a specific color scheme or adding their own images.
